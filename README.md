I am a final year postgraduate student of Computer Science, and was previously a Research Engineer.

Currently, I am looking for jobs in fields such as: Computer Vision, Machine Learning, or Deep Learning.

I have worked on structured, image, textual and audio data, and have utilized Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP techniques on the mentioned types of data respectively. I am comfortable working in Python using tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

I work diligently and take advantage of time to learn new concepts, tools and techniques. I have good mathematical, analytical and logical problem solving skills.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on _Nuclie Instance Segmentation of Histology Images as my PG thesis_.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning _Object Detection based and other methods for Instance Segmentation_.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on _any Computer Vision techniques to solve real-world problems_.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with _Instance Seg. especialy using Object Detection based techniques_.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about _Artificial Inteligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision_.
